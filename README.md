( It's pronounced "J in jek‚Ä≤t…ôr" - J injector )

Jinjector is a powerful tool written in Go, designed to inject backdoors into Joomla modules effortlessly. Using this tool, you can easily insert a PHP reverse shell into a Joomla module's main file, allowing a connection back to a specified IP and port whenever the module is triggered. This is perfect for penetration testers or researchers aiming to simulate real-world scenarios.

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool is intended for educational and ethical testing purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool on live systems without permission is illegal and unethical.

## ‚ú® Features 
- Automatic file discovery: Extracts information from the Joomla XML manifest file to locate the main file.
- Stealthy injection: Injects a PHP reverse shell that connects back to your specified IP and port.
- Ease of use: Specify your IP, port, and the module directory, and let Jinjector handle the rest.

## üì¶ Requirements
- Go
- Joomla module directory (with a valid manifest.xml file)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/giovanni-iannaccone/Jinjector
cd Jinjector
```
2. Build 
```bash
cd cmd
go build -o jinjector
```

## üöÄ Usage
1. Run the program 
```
jinjector --ip=YOUR_IP --port=YOUR_PORT --path=YOUR_PATH --backdoor=BACKDOOR_PATH
```
2. Load the infected module on the target site 
3. Start an http client on the port your gave in the previous step
4. Trigger the module by sendign a request to its position

## üåç How It Works 
**Manifest Extraction**: Jinjector parses the XML file in the given module directory to identify the main PHP file.
**Payload Injection**: Once located, it appends a PHP reverse shell payload to the main file.
**Connection Setup**: Every time the infected Joomla module is used, it attempts to establish a connection to your IP and port.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Reverse Shell Code
The reverse shell code injected is just a proof of concept, designed to open a connection to the specified IP and port. You can modify the payload if needed for specific testing purposes (backdoor.php file)
